# billbalancer

Takes a list of bills paid by multiple people and will balance them and say who needs to pay who and how much

**This is not complete yet, but _somewhat_ usable.**

## Running it

- Run it with py, follow prompts to make new files, add entries to them. 
- Re-run to add more files.
- Optionally, select an existing file and add more entries to it.
- When happy, continue to `balance` and it will print who owes who what.

## TODO

- [ ] Change `processed` tag to 1 when processed
- [ ] Add example csv files
- [ ] Add option to change directory (currently same dir as file)
- [ ] Upgrade to qt GUI interface
- [ ] Add option to increase print level to show intermediate calculations
- [ ] Add more file editing options
- [ ] Add conda install `environment.yml`
